# golgi-polarization
We are interested in the effects of a mutant gene on Golgi polarization after a wound edge is formed.

## Getting Started
### Interactive online experience available via Binder.
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/WillGiang/golgi-polarization/master)
You can click the Binder badge to play around with the Jupyter notebooks

### Prerequisites
You should have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

### Installing
After cloning this directory, you can re-create the environment from the `environment.yml` file
 with `conda` via your terminal or Anaconda prompt.

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

Once the environment has been created, you can activate it via the following OS dependent commands:

Windows: `activate polarization`

Mac OS X/Linux: `source activate polarization`

For more information, see [conda docs](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).
